### MongoDB Database Structure

Hereâ€™s a proposed structure for your MongoDB collections:

#### 1. Users Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "username": String,
  "password": String, // Hashed
  "role": { // Can be 'student', 'teacher', 'admin'
    "type": String,
    "permissions": [String] // E.g., ['view_students', 'edit_grades']
  },
  "name": String,
  "email": String,
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

#### 2. Students Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "user_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Users collection
  "enrollment_date": Date,
  "class_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Classes collection
  "attendance": [
    {
      "date": Date,
      "status": String // e.g., 'present', 'absent'
    }
  ],
  "grades": [
    {
      "course_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Courses collection
      "grade": Number
    }
  ],
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

#### 3. Teachers Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "user_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Users collection
  "subject": String,
  "classes": [ObjectId], // References to Classes collection
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

#### 4. Classes Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": String,
  "subject": String,
  "teacher_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Teachers collection
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day": String, // e.g., 'Monday'
      "time": String // e.g., '09:00 AM - 10:00 AM'
    }
  ],
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

#### 5. Courses Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": String,
  "description": String,
  "prerequisites": [String], // Array of course names
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

#### 6. Assignments Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "course_id": ObjectId, // Reference to Courses collection
  "title": String,
  "description": String,
  "due_date": Date,
  "created_at": Date,
  "updated_at": Date
}
```

### Implementation Tips

- **Authentication**: Use libraries like **bcrypt** for password hashing and **jsonwebtoken** for user authentication.
- **State Management**: For React, consider using **Context API** or **Redux** for global state management.
- **API Structure**: Set up RESTful API endpoints using Express.js for handling CRUD operations for each resource (students, teachers, classes, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: Use CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Material-UI** to create a responsive layout.
- **Testing**: Implement testing using tools like **Jest** and **Supertest** for API endpoints to ensure everything works correctly.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a well-structured and functional school management app. If you have specific questions or need more details on any part of the implementation, feel free to ask!
